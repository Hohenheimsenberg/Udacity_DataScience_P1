# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Project 1

The notebook in this git project, is part of the first project on the Udacitys Data Science Nanodegree.

## Summary
The objective of the project is to analize some of the data in the StackOverflow 2017 survey. The dataset can be obtained from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017) and be placed next to the exploration.ipynb file to run each cell.

**exploration.ipynb** is a Jupyter notebook with each step followed by the exploration. 

To properly execute the notebook, it needs the datase previusly linked and the next python libraries (Anaconda is advised):
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn
- sns

After the exploration phase, we get to the conclussion that there are 2 kind of data scientist profiles in the dataset. We use this fact to further explore the dataset and ask ourselves three questions: 
1. What categorical characteristics describe the two kind of data scientists?
2. Can we predict who is a non developer data scientist and who is a developer data scientist?
3. Can we predict what kind of workers are there? By mixing all kind of developer and non developer profiles.

The results of the analysis can be read in detail on the notebook.
